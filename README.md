# Coder_Decoder_Application
* This is my first C language Console user interface Application.
* It has two applications named as test1 and test2.
* Test1 is used for encrypting your message into raw and meaningless data. User of this application can set some key value for decryption of the raw data.
* Test2 is used for decrypting the raw and meangingless data back to original message, but user of this application only has three attempts to provide the right key to decrypt the data.
